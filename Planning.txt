MiniQuest Planning

Overview:
	Miniquest is a small advenure game without combat. The player must travel through the open world
	and find items to be able to progress. 
	
	The world is essentially a large puzzle where the player will constantly encounter roadblocks that
	are requiring a certain item to progress. 
	
	The big 2/3 concepts in this game:
		- Items that allow for progression
		- Secrets that point to lore and story
		- ......
	
	These items are things like:
		- pickaxe to break boulders
		- machete to clear vines
		- lantern to light up darkness
	
	There should also be environmental puzzles, things like:
		- clues hidden in plain sight in the world, possibly words or arrows written with tiles
		- illusory walls, like in dark souls ;)
		- ruins scattered around the world with a decipherable language that explains some lore and 
			points to secrets (this could just be a simple substitution cipher or an alternate font)
			
	One major component to make this a cohesive design would be create intersections of these concepts:
		- Player must explore to find secret lore/solve lore puzzles to find a hidden item that allows
			for progression
		** Once I come up with a 3rd major concept, I'll have 2 more intersections
